**Transformations** 
* The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
* The measurements on the mean and standard deviationwere extracted for each measurement.The others were discarded.
* The activity identifiers were replaced with descriptive activity names.
* The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names 
* From the data set in the previous step, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each      activity and each subject.
